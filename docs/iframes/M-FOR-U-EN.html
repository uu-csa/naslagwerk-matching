						<p class="add_space_below">Dear &lt;roepnaam student&gt;,</p>

						<p>We would like to welcome you to the Bachelor’s degree programme in <strong>&lt;opleiding_naam_en&gt;</strong> at Utrecht University. You applied for this programme via Studielink.</p>

						<p class="add_space_below">Utrecht University deems it important that you choose a fitting programme, allowing you to successfully complete your studies. For this reason, it is compulsory that you take part in the matching procedure which consists of completing the matching form and participating in the matching activity.</p>

						<h3 class="heading_main_text">What is matching?</h3>

						<p>Matching means that you will be comprehensively introduced to the degree programme of your choice before the start of your studies. You will have the opportunity to experience the programme before starting your studies, allowing you to obtain a realistic picture of what studying the programme entails. We will also discuss your motivation with you in order for you to find out whether the programme really suits you.</p>

						<p class="add_space_below">Participation in the matching procedure is a compulsory element of your application process. If you do not complete and submit the form on time, you will have failed to meet the matching obligation and your application will consequently be rejected. This means that you will not be able to start your studies.</p>

						<h3 class="heading_main_text">Matching at &lt;opleiding_naam_en&gt;</h3>

						<h4 class="heading_main_text">Step 1: <em>Complete the matching form</em></h4>

						<p class="add_space_below">Matching starts by completing the matching form. Please complete the form carefully (this will take about 30 minutes). Your answers will play a role during the matching activity and in the student coaching in the first year. Submit the form by clicking on the ‘Submit matching form’ button. Do this as soon as possible, preferably no later than 14 days after receiving this e-mail.</p>

						<h4 class="heading_main_text">Step 2: <em>Participate in the matching activity</em></h4>

						<p class="add_space_below">After you have completed the matching form, you will receive an e-mail invitation to the matching activity. At &lt;opleiding_naam_en&gt; this will consist of [ZELF IN TE VULLEN]. Participation in the activity is compulsory and will take place on [DATUM INVULLEN]. If you do not take part, your application will be rejected. This means that you will not be able to start your studies.</p>

						<h4 class="heading_main_text">Stap 3: <em>Make your final decision and register for the degree programme</em></h4>

						<p class="add_space_below">Once you have completed steps 1 and 2 and you are convinced that our degree programme is the right choice for you, we will be happy to welcome you as a first-year student in September 2019. Obviously, you will have to meet the academic entry requirements. Further information can be found on <a href="https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/en/&lt;opleiding_code&gt;">the website of the degree programme</a>.</p>

						<h4 class="heading_main_text">PLEASE NOTE:</h4>

						<ol class="add_space_below">
							<li>Filling out the matching form sooner, gives you the opportunity to participate in the matching activity earlier. This will help you decide if the programme is a good fit for you. If you find out that it is not, you will have more time to search for an alternative (and participate in the matching activity of that programme).</li>
							<li>If you do not fill out the form in time, your enrolment request will be rejected and in this case you cannot start your studies.</li>
							<li>Upon submitting the form, you will immediately be sent a confirmation of receipt. If you have not received this confirmation, please contact the Student Information Desk (via <a href="https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/en/&lt;opleiding_code&gt;">the website of our programme</a>, select <em>Contact</em>). It is your responsibility to make sure that the matching form has been submitted timely and correctly.</li>
							<li>You must provide an active e-mail address in Studielink. In the period after your application, please check this address regularly for messages from the university. Also check whether any messages from the university may have gone to your spam box.</li>
							<li>If you applied for more than one degree programme at Utrecht University, each of these programmes will ask you to complete their matching form. You will complete a matching procedure for each programme separately!</li>
							<li>6.	On all correspondence, please state your student number: &lt;studentnummer&gt;</li>
						</ol>

						<h3 class="heading_main_text">Online matching form</h3>

						<p>A large part of the application process is done online, via our OSIRIS Online Application website. Here you will also complete the matching form.

						<p>If you happen to be living abroad on the application deadline of 1 May and the travel distance prevents you from coming to Utrecht University to take part in the matching activity, you can request exemption from the matching procedure via <a href="https://www.formdesk.com/universiteitutrecht3/ontheffingsverzoek?def_week=&lt;volgende week&gt;&def_taal=English">this exemption request form</a>. Utrecht University will subsequently consult the Personal Records Database (BRP) to check whether you were registered at a Dutch address on 1 May. If this is not the case your request will be granted.</p>

						<p class="add_space_below">If you live abroad but still wish to take part in the matching activity, please contact the Student Information Desk of your degree programme (via <a href="https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/en/&lt;opleiding_code&gt;">the website of our programme</a>, select <em>Contact</em>).
